  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">How has computer science helped?</h2>

  <!--Spelling mistake "amyotrophic"-->
  <p>For the first time, a patient completely paralysed due to the neurodegenerative disease amytrophic lateral
  sclerosis (ALS) was able to communicate verbally through use of a brain-computer interface.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>The 37-year old man from Switzerland was able to form words and phrases, despite not having any voluntary muscle control including
  that of his vocal cords. Other similar devices have existed previously which are controlled by eye movement or any still functioning facial
  muscles, such as Stephen Hawking who used a device that allowed him to communicate by moving his cheek muscle.
  However, when use of these muscles is no longer feasible previously there would have been no way for the
  patient to communicate with those around them. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">How does it work?</h2>

  <p>
  Advances in computer science have meant that a brain-computer interface could be established through surgically
  implanting a device with microelectrodes into the brain of the patient and using computer software to translate
  electrical signals from the brain, this allowed for the patient to match the frequency of his brain
  waves to a certain tone, word, or phrase. Thus meaning that the patient could achieve either a positive or negative
  result from the system.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why is this significant?</h2>

  <p>Historically, communication from those in a fully locked-in state has not been possible, and so those behind
  this project were unsure if the system would actually work for the patient or not. However, months later the
  patient is able to communicate with their family effortlessly - something which, without computer science,
  would have been unimaginable.
